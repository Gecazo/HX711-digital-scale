## HX711 Demo
This code provides a demo for using the HX711 library to interface with a load cell and obtain weight measurements.

## Requirements
To run this code, you need:

An Arduino board (or compatible board)
A load cell with HX711 amplifier circuit
The HX711 library (available on the Arduino IDE's library manager)
Installation
1. Connect the load cell to the HX711 amplifier circuit, and connect the amplifier circuit to the Arduino board. The wiring should be as follows:

* HX711 DT -> Arduino A1
* HX711 SCK -> Arduino A0
* HX711 VCC -> Arduino 5V
* HX711 GND -> Arduino GND
* Load cell red wire -> HX711 E+
* Load cell black wire -> HX711 E-
* Load cell white wire -> HX711 A-
* Load cell green wire -> HX711 A+

2. Install the HX711 library in the Arduino IDE by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries..., searching for "HX711", and clicking "Install".

3. Open the provided code in the Arduino IDE, and upload it to the Arduino board.

## Usage
Once the code is uploaded to the Arduino board, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the output.
The output will show the raw and calibrated weight measurements, as well as the mean and standard deviation of a set of readings. The code can be modified to adjust the number of readings taken and the scale factor used for calibration.

## Calibration
To obtain accurate weight measurements, the load cell must be calibrated with known weights. The calibration factor can then be set using the set_scale() function in the code.
For example, if a 1kg weight is placed on the load cell, and the raw reading is 2000, then the calibration factor would be 2000/1000 = 2.0. This value can be passed to the set_scale() function to calibrate the scale: scale.set_scale(2.0).
